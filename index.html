			<p style="font-size:30px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="font-size:50px; color:yellow;">E</span>ngineering (B.E., or B.Tech.,) is among the most popular graduation courses
				that students take after completing their school. Choosing the right career can
				be confusing for many students. The world is full of opportunities. And you
	 			might not be aware of most of them. One has to know the list of all career options
	  		after engineering to select the right one.
			</p>
			<p style="font-size:30px">Higher Studies
					One of the most popular career options after engineering is to pursue further studies.
					If you’re a B.Tech student, then you can prepare for the GATE exam.
					GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) is an exam that tests the
					comprehensive understanding of undergraduate engineering subjects.
					With an excellent GATE score, you can enter prestigious engineering
					colleges (IITs and NITs) for M.Tech. M.Tech is one of the preferred courses after engineering.
			</p>
			<p style="font-size:30px">There was a time when engineers shied away from entrepreneurship.
					But the successes of many engineer entrepreneurs in recent years have inspired the youth.
					You can choose to start your entrepreneurial journey after graduating.
			</p>
			<p style="font-size:30px">It is one of the most favourite career options after engineering for most of the engineering students.
					You can choose to get an engineering job through campus placements. Campus placements can help you get
					a high-paying job even before you get your degree.
					Campus placements can be very lucrative. The number of job offers worth more than one
					crore has increased considerably in the past few years.
